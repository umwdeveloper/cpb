                            The Consumer Protection Bureau (CPB) is proud to declare a <b>major victory for consumers
                                and a
                                direct success</b> of our recent campaigns aimed at strengthening transparency,
                            fairness, and
                            accountability across UK markets. We welcome the UK Government’s adoption of tougher
                            consumer protection measures under the newly reinforced Digital Markets, Competition and
                            Consumers Act, and applaud the leadership of Justin Madders MP, Minister for Competition and
                            Markets, for taking decisive action.

                                    This legislation reflects several key reforms that CPB has persistently called for,
                                    including:
                                </p>
                                <ul>

                                        <b>A legal ban on fake and manipulated reviews,</b> ensuring platforms are held
                                        responsible for the accuracy of consumer feedback
                                    </li>
                                    <li class="text">
                                        The <b>outlawing of hidden charges, </b> including <b>undeclared service charges
                                            in restaurant bills,</b> concealed broadband installation costs, and hidden
                                        air fare surcharges
                                    </li>

                                        <b>A crackdown on FOMO-based</b> (fear of missing out) <b>pricing tactics,</b>
                                        which exploit psychological pressure to push unnecessary spending

                                    These reforms are a clear response to CPB’s national campaigns, including our
                                    high-profile challenge to restaurant chains that failed to disclose automatic
                                    service charges and misled customers into tipping on top. They bring the law in line
                                    with the reality of today’s digital marketplaces, and empower consumers with <b> greater
                                    clarity, control, and confidence </b> in their everyday purchases. For too long,
                                    consumers have been left in the dark- paying more than advertised, more than
                                    expected, and more than fair. This ends now.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text">
                                This is more than a policy win—it is a <b>wake-up call to businesses, platforms, and service providers</b> that the era of murky charges and manipulated markets is over. CPB will continue to monitor enforcement, report violations, and push for robust penalties against offenders.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text">
                                The strengthened Digital Markets Act is a major step forward—and a testament to the power of <b>public advocacy, regulatory pressure, and CPB’s continued commitment to defending consumers.</b>
                                </p>

                                <p class="text">
                                Our recent <b>severe warning to TrustPilot</b> highlighted the platform’s persistent failure to remove fake reviews or penalise offenders. Such negligence erodes trust and skews honest competition. With this new law, digital platforms are put on formal notice: protect consumers or face consequences.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text">
                                CPB stands ready to support enforcement and will continue to monitor compliance closely. We remain committed to pushing for the <b>strictest possible penalties</b> for any business, marketplace, or platform that breaches these new rules.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text">
                                This is a watershed moment for consumer protection—and a strong signal that the voices of consumers, amplified by CPB, are being heard at the highest levels of government.

                                    This case came to light only after the <b>Compliance and Risk Consultancy (CRC)</b>
                                    group,
                                    through its <b>Consumer Protection Bureau (CPB)</b>, intervened. When <b>Wazim
                                        Nazir, Owner of ACW</b>
                                    sought to
                                    voluntarily wind up HSQ and PL1, <b>CRC raised formal objections </b> and mobilised
                                    affected
                                    property owners to challenge the application. Many owners provided statements and
                                    depositions to ADGM with CPB's assistance, exposing Nazir's misconduct and systemic
                                    violations. Without this organised and strategic push, Nazir and his entities might
                                    have escaped scrutiny entirely.

                                    The ADGM Registration Authority's investigation unveiled Nazir's deliberate
                                    misrepresentation and obstruction, culminating in hefty fines and public censure.
                                    This is not just a victory for justice but also a stark reminder of the power of
                                    unified consumer action when supported by organisations like CPB.

                                        While the ADGM decision serves as a critical win, the plight of property owners
                                        at <b> Hanover Square Central and Platinum One (PL1) </b> remains unresolved.
                                        CPB has
                                        identified significant consumer rights violations stemming from the exploitative

                                        Wazim
                                        Nazir.

                                        This SPA binds owners to ACW's management for <b>20 years</b> with no exit
                                        options—a
                                        clause that not only deprives owners of their legal rights but also locks them
                                        into years of financial distress. ACW continues to rent out the apartments
                                        without providing owners with any meaningful <b>Return on Investment (ROI)</b>.
                                        Frustration is widespread: only a small fraction of owners receive minimal
                                        returns, while the majority have suffered losses with no clear remedy in sight.

                                        While this decision marks progress, the fight is far from over. The property
                                        owners of HSQ and PL1 remain in a dire situation. Their apartments are managed
                                        by ACW, owned by Wazim Nazir, a company operating under a deeply flawed Sales
                                        and Purchase Agreement (SPA). This SPA includes abusive clauses, denying owners
                                        any exit option and binding them to ACW's management for an astonishing 20

                                        Most owners are angry and disappointed. Their properties are rented out, yet
                                        they have received little to no ROI for several years. Only a small handful are
                                        receiving minimal returns, which amount to little more than peanuts compared to
                                        market expectations. This untenable situation has shattered trust and further
                                        exacerbated financial losses for already frustrated owners.
